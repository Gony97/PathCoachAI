# PathCoachAI
an agent that creates personalised learning paths or project suggestions for users based on their profile (skills, goals, past performance). It will use GenAI to ask the user questions, build a profile, then recommend a path, create a plan, and monitor progress. Then deploy as SaaS-style service.
